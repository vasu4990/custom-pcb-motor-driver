# Custom PCB Motor Driver

[![Engineering Checks](https://github.com/vasu4990/custom-pcb-motor-driver/actions/workflows/checks.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/vasu4990/custom-pcb-motor-driver/actions/workflows/checks.yml)

An engineering-grade reference package for a compact **dual brushed-DC motor driver** for mobile robotics. The project now combines a concrete semiconductor profile, machine-readable electrical decisions, tolerance-aware sizing math, a schematic connectivity contract, BOM traceability, PCB/thermal rules, staged validation gates, and automated repository checks.

> **Status:** engineering reference, **not a fabricated or bench-validated PCB**. The electrical architecture and reference calculations are defined; real CAD capture, footprint verification, ERC/DRC, fabrication and measured load/thermal results remain required before this can be called hardware-validated.

## Why this repository is different

Instead of leaving the motor-driver IC and key values as placeholders, this repository defines a concrete **TI DRV8848** reference profile while preserving a reusable architecture. Critical assumptions live in YAML/CSV and are checked by code rather than buried only in prose.

The repository includes:

- DRV8848 reference profile with datasheet provenance
- tolerance-aware current-limit calculations
- conduction-loss and rough thermal screening
- traceable engineering BOM with critical-component state
- machine-readable schematic connectivity contract
- documented electrical interfaces and safe states
- test-point plan for first-article validation
- PCB layout and PowerPAD/thermal guidance
- staged `reference` → `cad-ready` → `fab-ready` → `hardware-validated` release gates
- BOM and netlist linters
- generated Markdown/JSON engineering reports
- unit-tested calculation tools and CI
- bring-up, validation, FMEA and manufacturing-release documentation

## Reference design

| Item | Reference target |
|---|---|
| Motor driver | TI DRV8848PWPR |
| Motor channels | 2 brushed DC |
| Application VM | 6–12.6 V |
| Expected continuous load | 0.75 A/channel |
| Current regulation | 0.56 Ω sense resistor/channel, VREF = VINT |
| Nominal modeled current limit | ~0.893 A/channel |
| Modeled tolerance range | ~0.838–0.948 A/channel |
| PWM target | 20 kHz |
| VM local decoupling | 0.1 µF + 22 µF / 25 V |
| VINT bypass | 2.2 µF |
| Reference PCB | 2 layer, 2 oz copper, ground plane, exposed-pad thermal vias |

These are **reference design targets**, not measured specifications.

See [`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md), [`docs/ELECTRICAL_DESIGN.md`](docs/ELECTRICAL_DESIGN.md) and [`docs/REFERENCE_PROFILE_DRV8848.md`](docs/REFERENCE_PROFILE_DRV8848.md).

## Automated engineering checks

Install development dependencies and run:

```bash
python -m pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
pytest -q
python tools/design_check.py
python tools/bom_lint.py
python tools/netlist_lint.py
python tools/generate_report.py
python tools/release_gate.py reference
```

A `fab-ready` gate is expected to fail today:

```bash
python tools/release_gate.py fab-ready
```

That failure is intentional. It prevents the repository from silently claiming ERC, DRC or Gerber review that has not happened.

## Engineering model

The main sizing utility evaluates the reference YAML against the DRV8848 profile. It checks application voltage, PWM frequency, nominal and tolerance-aware current limits, sense-resistor loading, local decoupling, and a deliberately simple junction-temperature screen.

The thermal result uses datasheet θJA as a **screening calculation only**. Actual junction/board temperature depends on PCB copper, exposed-pad soldering, via construction, airflow, enclosure and operating waveform, so hardware thermal testing remains mandatory.

## Release truth table

| Stage | Current state |
|---|---|
| Engineering reference | ✅ |
| CAD ready | ❌ — real schematic/footprint/ERC evidence missing |
| Fabrication ready | ❌ — PCB/DRC/Gerber review missing |
| Fabricated | ❌ |
| Hardware validated | ❌ — no measured motor/thermal/stall data yet |

The source of truth is [`hardware/design_values.yaml`](hardware/design_values.yaml), and [`tools/release_gate.py`](tools/release_gate.py) enforces the evidence required for each stage.

## Key engineering decisions

**Current regulation.** The reference uses a 0.56 Ω sense resistor per channel with VREF tied to VINT. The model includes VINT and resistor tolerance rather than trusting only a nominal current-limit number.

**Thermal strategy.** The exposed pad, ground plane and thermal vias are part of the electrical design, not optional cosmetics. Rough thermal math is used to catch obviously bad choices early, then real hardware measurements must replace estimates.

**Protection stays application-specific.** Fuse, reverse-polarity device, TVS and optional bulk capacitance cannot be selected credibly without the final battery/source, cable/harness and motor transient behavior. The repo documents the architecture and review criteria instead of inventing part numbers.

**CAD honesty.** The repo does not contain fake KiCad/Altium source files. [`hardware/cad/netlist_spec.yaml`](hardware/cad/netlist_spec.yaml) defines the connectivity contract for the real schematic when CAD work begins.

## Before ordering a PCB

Complete [`docs/DESIGN_REVIEW_CHECKLIST.md`](docs/DESIGN_REVIEW_CHECKLIST.md), create and independently verify the real CAD files, run ERC/DRC, review fabrication outputs, and satisfy the `fab-ready` gate with actual evidence.

## First article

Follow [`docs/BRINGUP.md`](docs/BRINGUP.md) and [`docs/VALIDATION_PLAN.md`](docs/VALIDATION_PLAN.md). Start from current-limited power with no motors, verify VINT/nFAULT/nSLEEP, test each bridge separately, verify current regulation, then move to dual-channel load and thermal testing.

## Primary component sources

The reference profile is derived from Texas Instruments' DRV8848 product page and datasheet. Re-check the current datasheet revision and device lifecycle before a real procurement/fabrication release.
